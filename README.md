Dear friends , 
 Greetings from Kolkata. On behalf of the organizers for the workshop on 19-20th April , here in Kolkata , I am writing to request you formally to be in the faculty. Professor Arun Sanyal have been in touch with you on this but I felt it is our duty - the help and  support that you are providing will go a long way in fostering capabilities of a core Liver research team in India. We have selected 15 early career scientists focussed in Liver research and would likely to provide them hand holding in their project , beginning with this workshop. I am attaching brochure for the program for your understanding .   

I hope you have had your presentations in shape by now . Please let us know your convenience ( based on time and preference) of presenting live over ZOOM or Video prerecorded talk. We will plan accordingly . 

We are happy that we will Arun Sanyal, Saul Karpen, Shadab Siddiqui  and Shyam Kottilil are physically joining us  here in Kolkata . 

Look forward to continued collaborations on this program that - within the framework of the VCU - JCMLRI  existing memorandum of exchange and research collaborations - would strengthen ties between the two institutes . 

Regards 
Abhijit
